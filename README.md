# scraped_grades_data
These are the grades of three midterms exams for 3 different subjects.
I plotted the histograms for them, they provide a visual clue for the grades distribution.
can be used to visually assess which exams were easy or hard.
or if the distribution was bi-modal which indicates that cheating happened or something wrong in grading.
## Prerequisites
You only need to install R to run the code. for example:
```
sudo apt-get install r-base
```
after cloning the repo, run script.r using R, it will produce the hisograms in the same directory in .pdf files
```
Rscript script.r
```
that's it!
